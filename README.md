# SOB_Prototype
This is the working prototype of NS3 simulation of P2Pool_V2

For the topology we are using small world netowrk  
With TCP using gossip push protocol 
we are having persistent connections over the simulation periord 
we have a mining application where the network mines one block every 10 sec 
we also have a report application which reports the block propogation rate of the network every 30 sec

i have ran for 10000 nodes 
but i messed up a little bit  in the mining application as you can see the network only mined only 7 blocks

after fixing the mining application 
i have ran the simualtion for 1000 nodes where a block is minined every 10secs

i will run the simualtion for 10k nodes very sooon 
I know the prototype is not complete in terms of network but will make it better
